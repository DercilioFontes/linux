- Deleting a line: `Ctrl + U`

- Deleting a word: `Ctrl + W`

- Abort: `Ctrl + C`

## `man`

- Use `SPACE` bar to show another page

- Use `H` to display a list of `less` commands

- Use `Q` to exit

## `info`

- Use `SPACE` bar or `N` to go to another page

- Use `DEL` or `P` to go back

- `m<Texinfo> RET` visits the Texinfo manual

- `H` lists all Info commands

## Quoting/Scaping characters

- To quote, or scape, a character precede it with a backslash (`\`)

- Another way is to enclose them between single quotation marks (`'**'`)

## `cp`

- `cp source-file destination-file`

- Caution: If `destination-file` exists before, `cp` overwrites it. It is good idea to use `-i` or `--interactive` option. It checks with you before overwrites a file.

## `mv`

- `mv existing-filename new-filename`

- If you want to rename a file without making a duplicate copy of it, you can use `mv`

- `mv existing-file-list directory`

- Moves a file or files to a new directory.

- `mv existing-directory-list directory`

- Moves a directory or directories to a new directory.

## `grep` (global regular expression print)

- `grep <word> <filename>`

- `grep '<word> <word>' <filename>`

- It searches for the text and displays each line that has it

- It accepts more the one file

## `head`

- `head <filename>`

- It displays the first ten lines of a file.

- `head -<n> <filename>`. n: number of lines

## `tail`

- `tail <filename>`

- It displays the last ten lines of a file.

- `tail -<n> <filename>`. n: number of lines

## `sort`

- `sort <filename>`

- It displays the contents of a file in order by line.

## `uniq` (unique)

- `uniq <filename>`

- It display a file, skkiping adjacent duplicate lines.

- `sort <filename> | uniq` --> Sorted before processed by `uniq`, ensures that no two lines are the same.

## `diff`

- `diff <filename1> <filename2>`

- It compares two files and displays a list of the difference between them.

## `file`

- `file <filename>`

- It determines file type.

## `echo`

- `echo <text>`

- It display the text on terminal.

## `date`

- `date` --> Tue Dec 24 21:55:08 UTC 2024

- It display the time and date on terminal.

## `ls` (list files)

- `ls -l`: (long) show more info about files.

- `ls -a`: (all) displays _all files_, even invisible ones.

## `gzip`

- `gzip <filename>`

- It compresses a file

- `-v` or `--verbose` option reports how much is was able to compress.

## `gunzip`

- `gunzip <filename>.gz`

- It decompresses a file

## `zcat`

- `zcat <filename>.gz`

- It display the file content decompressed but keeps it compressed.

Note: Do not confuse `gzip` and `gunzip` with `zip` and `unzip`. These are used to pack and unpack zip files containing several files compressed into a single file.

## `tar` (tape archive)

- It original function was to create and read archive tapes. Today it is used to create single files that, when unpacked, create a directory with any level of subdirectories and subfiles beneath it.

- Often the `tar` files are compressed with `gzip`, and has filename extension `.tar.gz` or `.tgz`

- Creating a tar file: `tar cvf <name_of_archive>.tar <dirname>/`

- Creating a tarball (gzipped) file: `tar cvzf <name_of_archive>.tar.gz <dirname>/`

- Separating a tar file into component files: `tar xvf <name_of_archive>.tar(.gz) -c <dirname>/`

Note: You donâ€™t need to specify the directory name while separating a tar file into its component files. You can specify the directory name if you want to extract the tar file to directory other than the current one.

## `which`, `whereis` and `type`

- Helps to locate commands by giving its pathname to the file for the command.

- When you type the name of a command, the shell searches for the command in your search path and runs the first one it finds.

- `which` finds which copy of the program the shell runs.

- `whereis` looks in a few standard locations instead of using your search path. It also find any `man` pages for the command.

- `type` also shows if the command is a shell builtin or its pathname.

## `apropos`

- `apropos sort` --> `man -k sort` (-k: keyword)

- It lists the short description lines for all man pages that contain the keyword somewhere in the header line.

## `who`, `whoami`, `w` and `finger`

- For obtaining users and system information

## `write`, `talk`, and `pine` (email)

- For communication with other users

- `mesg n` --> to disable messages

- `mesg y` --> to enable

## Invisible file/directory

- `.dockerenv` / `.git`

- A filename that begins with a period is called _invisible file_ because `ls` does not display it.

- The command `ls -a` displays _all files_, even invisible ones.

## `mkdir`

- `mkdir /home/dafdev/docs`

- It creates a directory.

## `rmdir`

- `rmdir /home/dafdev/docs`

- It removes a directory.

- You cannot delete the working directory or a directory that contains entries other than `.` and `..`.

- If you need to delete a directory with files in it, first delete the files using `rm` and then delete the directory.

- `rm -r <directory>` --> recursively deletes the files (and other subdirectories) whithin a directory and also deletes teh directory itself.

- **Caution**: You must use it carefully. It is quite easy to wipe out your home directory with a single, short command.

## `pwd` (print working directory)

- `pwd`

- It displays the pathname or the working directory.

- When you first log in on a Linux system, the working directory is your _home directory_.

## Startup files

- The shell executes the commands in this file each time you log in.

- `bash` --> `.profile`

- `zsh` --> `zprifile`

## `cd` (change directory)

- `cd var/log`

- Without an argument, `cd` makes your home directory the working directory, as it was when you first logged in.

## Special pathnames

- `~/` --> at the start of a pathname denote your home directory

- `~<user>/` --> A tilde followed by a login name denotes that's user home directory.

## Access permissions

- Three types of users can access a file:

  - the owner of the file (_owner_)
  - a member of a group to which the owner belongs (_group_)
  - everyone else (_other_)

- A user can attempt to access a ordinany file in three ways, by trying to:

  - _read from_
  - _write to_
  - _execute it_

- Three types of users, each able to access a file in three ways, equal to a total of _nine possible_ ways to access a ordinary file.

- `ls -l` --> `drwxr-xr-x   2 root root 4096 Apr 22  2024 boot`

## Changing access permissions

- The owner of a file controls which users have permission to access the file and how they can access it.

- `chmod` (change mode)
  - `chmod a+rw <filename>` --> adds (+) read and write (rw) for all users
  - `chmod o-rx <filename>` --> removes (-) read and execute (rx) permissions for other (o) users

- In addition to `a` (for _all_) and `o` (for _other_), you can use `g` (for _group_) and `u` (for _user_, although user actually refers to the owner of the file, who may or may not be the user of the file at any given time)

- Note: The user who knows the `root` password can log in as **Superuser** and have full access to _all_ files, regardless of owner or access permissions.

## Directory access permissions

- Access permissions have a slightly different meanings when used with directory. Execute access permission is redefined for a directory. It means you can search through the directory. It has nothing to do with executing a file.

- `chmod a+rwx <dir>`

## Links

- `ln` (link): creates an additional link to an existing file.

- `ln exisiting-file new-link`

- The `ln` utility creates am additional pointer to an existing file. It does not make another copy of the file. The file status information is the same for all links. Only the filenames differ.

## `df`

- It displays all mounted filesystems along with information about each.

## The terminal as file

- The Linux system has an additional type of file, a _device file_. A device file resides in the Linux file structure, usually in the `/dev` directory, and representes a peripheral device such as a terminal, printer or disk drive.

- The command `tty` displays the name of the terminal you give the command from.
